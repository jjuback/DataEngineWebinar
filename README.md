# DataEngineWebinar
Sample projects from webinar "ComponentOne DataEngine Deep-Dive"

## Instructions
All samples require prior installation of .NET 5.0, and can be executed from the command line via `dotnet run`.

The NFLStats sample (Blazor Server) requires a [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) account in order to download the data file. See `NFLStats\workspace\import.cmd` for details.

The other samples require a SQL Server connection to the Northwind database. You may need to modify the connection string in `Program.cs`.
